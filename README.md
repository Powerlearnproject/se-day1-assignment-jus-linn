#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to design, develop, test, and maintain software systems. It ensures the creation of high-quality, reliable, and efficient software that meets user needs. Its importance in the tecnology industry lies in enabling scalable, maintainable, and secure solutions, driving innovation, reducing costs, and ensuring compliance with standards. It fosters collaboration, improve user satisfaction, and supports the development of technologies like AI, making it essential for progress in the digital world. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The Software Crisis and The birth of Software Engineering
   The term software engineering began at 1968 NATO conference, emphasizing the need for systematic, engineering-like practices. It marked the beginning of structured programming, modular design, and the formalization of software development processes.
2. The rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Agile Development
   The emergence of object-oriented programming introduced concepts like encapsulation, inheritence, and polymorphism. It later led to the development of Agile methodologies, which emphasized flexibility, customer collaboration, and iterative development.
3. The Advent of DevOps and Continuous Delivery
   Technology improvement brought about the rise of DevOps, a cultural and technical movement that bridges the gap between development and operation teams. It focuses on automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery to streamline software development

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirements gathering analysis- understand what the software needs to do, gather requirements, define objectives, and document functional and non-functional requirememnts.
2. Design- plan how the software will be built, create acrchitecture system, define components, and design user-interface. It helps outline the systems structure and behaviour.
3. Implementation- building the software by writing code based on the design specifications and following coding standards.
4. Testing- ensure the software works as intended bug free by performing unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing to identify and fix bugs.
5. Deployment- to release the software for use by installing it in the production environment, configure settings, and ensure it runs smoothly.
6. Maintenance- to keep the software functional and up to date by fixing bugs, releasing updates, and adding new features based on user feedback.
   

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology is a linear, step by step approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next. Example is when building a bridge, the requirements of length, materials and others are well defined and unlikely to change to minimize risks.
on the other hand,
Agile methodology is an iterative, flexible approach where software is developed in bits. Requirements and solutions evolve through the process. Example using a startup to build a social media app. The requirements change depending on user feedback and the team releases frequent updates. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer- role is to build and maintain software, responsibilities include writing code, debugging, collaborating, and staying updated on technology.
Quality Assuarance Engineer- role is to ensure the software quality, responsibilities inclue testing the software, reporting bugs, and imptoving testing processes.
Project Manager- role is to manage the project delivery, responsibilities include planning, tracking progress, managing resources, and communicating with stakeholders.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated development environments streamline software development by providing a platform for coding, debugging, and testing. They enhance productivity with features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and offers extensions for additional functionality. Example; Visual Studio Code, which we use here in our assignments supports multiple programming language, integrates with Git for version control, and offers extensions.
Version control systems tracks changes to code, enabling collaboration, maintaining history, and preventing conflicts. It allows developers to return to previous versions and work on features simultaneously. Example; Git, a widely used VCS, developer can create branches to work on new features without affecting the main codebase.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Changing requirements
   Stakeholders may change or add requirements during development, overcome this by using agile methodologies to accomodate changes iteratively.
2. Tight deadlines
   Short timelines can lead to rushed work and low quality input, overcome this by breaking the project into smaller, manageable tasks using sprints and avoiding overcommiting.
3. Technical debt
   This is when you take shortcuts in writing code which lead to a harder to maintain codebase, overcome by following coding standards and best practices, regularly refractor code to improve quality, and allocate time in the development cycle to address the technical debts might have used.
4. Communication issues
   Miscommunication with teams or stakeholders can lead to misunderstandings, overcome by holding regular meetings to ensure flow of communication, use collaborative tools like Microsoft teams and share updates.
5. Debugging complesx issues
   Fixing bugs in complex systems can be time consuming, overcome by using the debugging tools and logging trace issues, write unit tests and conduct code reviews, and collaborate with teammates.
6. Keeping up with technology
   Technology evolves rapidly, making it hard to always stay updated, overcome by dedicating time to learning new technologies, attending workshops, webinars, and participate in developer communities.
7. Team collaboration
   Working with diverse teams can be difficult, overcome by using a version control systems to manage collaborative coding, define clear roles and responsibilities within the teams, and foster a culture of respect and open communication.
8. Security vulnerabilities
   Cyber threats, overcome by following secure coding practices and conduct regular security audits, and using tools like static code analyzers to detect vulnerabilities.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing
It is the testing of individual components of code in isolation, it verifies that each unit works correctly. Its importance is that it catches bugs early in the development process and simplifies debugging by isolation issues.

Integration testing
testing how different modules work together, purposely to ensure that combined components function as expected. Its importance is to identify issues in interactions between modules and validates data flow and communication across components.

System testing
Testing the complete, integrated system to verify that it meets specified requirements, purposely to evaluate the system compliance with functional and non-functional requirements. Its importance is to ensure the system works as a whole and tests performance, security, and usability.

Acceptance testing
Testing conducted to determine if the system meets business requirements and is ready for delivery, its purpose is to validate the software with end users. Its importance is to ensure the software meets user needs, expectations, and acts as the final gate before deployment. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining the input prompts given to AI models like Chat GPT among others to elicit the desired output. It involves crafting questions, instructions, or context in a way that guide the model to generate accurate, relevant, or creative responses. 
Its importance:
  Reduces ambiguity and ensures the model understands the task given to imptove the output quality.
  Allows users to guide the model's behaviour and tone, for example whether its formal, professional, or technical to enhancr control.
  Reduces the need for multiple iterations by getting the desired response in fewer attempts and saves times and effort.
  Tailors prompts for specific tasks, such as generating code, writing blogs, or summarizing documents which is by enabling specialized use cases
  Ensures the model adheres to constraints, for example, word limits, or specific formats.
  

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt- 'Tell me about history'
  The model will provide a broad, unfocused response such as a general overview of world history, which may not be useful for users specific needs.

Improved prompt- 'Explain the causes and key events of the American Revolution in 5 sentences.
  The model will provide a concise summary focused on the causes and major events of the American Revolution.

Improved Prompt
Clear and Specific- it narrows the topic to the American Revolution and specifies the focus on the causes and key events.
Concise- it limits the response to 5 sentences, ensuring the response is brief.
Relevance- it ensures the response is dirctly useful to the user's needs, avoiding unnecessary or irrelevant information.
